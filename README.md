The application is built with Node.js and Express and serves as a social media platform that allows users to register, log in, and interact with content generated by themselves and their friends. Users can create new posts, comment on existing ones, and like or dislike both posts and comments. Each user's timeline displays their posts along with their friends', offering a dynamic and personalized social experience.

Register:
- A new user accesses the application and completes a registration form.
- the user-provided information (such as name, email address, and password) is sent to the server.
- On the server, the information is validated to ensure it is in the correct format and that the email address is not already in use.
- If all information is valid, the account is created in the database, and the user receives a response confirming the registration was successful.

Log in:
- After registering, the user can log in using their email address and password.
- These credentials are sent to the server for authentication.
- The server verifies whether an account exists with the provided email address and password.
- If the credentials are correct, the server generates an authentication token and stores it in a cookie for use in subsequent requests to the server.

Viewing Posts:
- After logging in, the user accesses the timeline page.
- The server retrieves posts from the database, including those created by the user and their friends.
- The posts are sent back to the client and displayed on the timeline page.

Adding a Post:
- The user fills out a form to create a new post.
- The client sends the post details to the server.
- The server validates and stores the post in the database, associating it with the user's account.

Adding a Comment:
- The user views a post and decides to add a comment.
- The server validates and stores the comment in the database, associating it with the respective post.

Liking a Post or Comment:
- The user clicks the like or dislike button next to a post or comment.
- The client sends the request to the server, including the user ID and the post/comment ID.
- The server updates the likes array for the post or comment in the database.
